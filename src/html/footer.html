                When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it’s called augmented learning. By adapting to
                the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner’s
                natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice).
                By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a
                lifetime. See also minimally invasive.
